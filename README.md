# Analyzing Drilling Campaign Data in Power BI

Final project of the BI Upskilling at IT Academy by Barcelona Activa. For this project, I conducted an analysis of a Drilling Campaign using Business Intelligence tools. Here is a summary of the findings:

1. It was identified that the costs associated with the services generated by the drill, especially its daily rate, have the greatest impact on the overall campaign costs.
2. Logistics costs derived from the operational base dedicated to drilling operations were also found to make a significant contribution.
3. Non-productive time during the drilling campaign accounted for 46.51%, negatively affecting the overall efficiency of the campaign.
4. Drilling of the various holes is the activity that utilizes the highest percentage of total time spent in well construction.

As a weakness of the study, a breakdown of non-productive time was not available. It would be important for future studies to conduct a detailed analysis of non-productive time to identify the factors that contributed the most to these non-productive periods.

Also, as a recommendation, it would be beneficial to compare the actual costs and time with the planned costs and time. This comparison would provide insights into any deviations or discrepancies between the projected and actual outcomes. It would help in identifying areas where improvements can be made in cost management and scheduling for future drilling campaigns.
